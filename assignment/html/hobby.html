    <p>Ancient Garba is a traditional folk dance of Gujarat, performed to honor Goddess Durga during festivals like Navratri. It originated as a devotional practice symbolizing the cycle of life, birth, and rebirth. In earlier times, people danced around a clay lamp called Garbha Deep, which represented divine energy and the presence of the goddess. Traditionally, women wore colorful ethnic attire and sang devotional songs while performing graceful circular movements. Unlike modern Garba, ancient Garba focused more on spiritual devotion and cultural rituals than entertainment.</p>
